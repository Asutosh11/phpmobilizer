phpMobilizer allows website owners to add mobile capabilities to their existing websites.


### What is it? ###
Automatically convert your existing website to a mobile website. phpMobilizer operates similar to many of the mobile website converters available, but it runs on your own server.

The goal of the project is to make it as universal as possible. Just drop the files into a subdomain for automatic conversion. Add just one line of PHP to your main site if you want automatic redirection to the mobile site when someone accesses it with a phone or mobile device.


### Features ###
  * Easy to set up. Just create a new subdomain for your site and upload the files.
  * Converts any website to a mobile site.
  * Resizes images for mobile sized browsers. Not only does it make them fit, but it reduces download size as well.
  * Automatic redirect to the mobile site is available. (Just add one line of code to your existing site.)


### Requirements ###
  * PHP 5<br>
<ul><li>Apache (.htaccess/mod_rewrite capable)</li></ul>
